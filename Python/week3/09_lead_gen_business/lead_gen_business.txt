1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

    SELECT SUM(amount), charged_datetime FROM billing
    WHERE charged_datetime LIKE '2012-03%';

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with
an id of 2?

    SELECT SUM(amount), client_id FROM billing
    WHERE client_id = '2';

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

    SELECT domain_name FROM sites
    WHERE client_id = '10'
    ORDER BY domain_name ASC;

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created each month for the

    SELECT COUNT(domain_name),MONTH(created_datetime), client_id FROM sites
    WHERE client_id = '1'
    GROUP BY MONTH(created_datetime)
    ORDER BY MONTH(created_datetime) ASC;
    client with an id of 1?

What about for client=20?

    SELECT COUNT(domain_name),MONTH(created_datetime), client_id FROM sites
    WHERE client_id = '20'
    GROUP BY MONTH(created_datetime)
    ORDER BY MONTH(created_datetime) ASC;

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads we've generated for each
of our sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

    SELECT COUNT(leads_id) FROM leads
    WHERE registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01%' AND '2011-02-15%';

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of
leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to
December 31, 2011?

    SELECT CONCAT(clients.last_name, ', ', clients.first_name) AS name,
        COUNT(leads_id) FROM sites
    JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    WHERE registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01%' AND '2011-12-31'
    GROUP BY name;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client name and the total # of
leads we've generated for each client each month between month 1 - 6 of Year
2011?

    SELECT CONCAT(clients.last_name, ', ', clients.first_name) AS name, registered_datetime, COUNT(leads_id)  FROM sites
    JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    WHERE MONTH(registered_datetime) BETWEEN '1' AND '6'
    GROUP BY name;

8. What query would you run to get a list of client name and the total # of
leads we've generated for each of our client's sites between January 1, 2011 to
December 31, 2011?

    SELECT CONCAT(clients.last_name, ', ', clients.first_name) AS name, sites.site_id, COUNT(leads_id) FROM sites
    JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    WHERE registered_datetime BETWEEN '2011-01-01%' AND '2011-12-31%'
    GROUP BY site_id
    ORDER BY name;

Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and
the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

    SELECT CONCAT(clients.last_name, ', ', clients.first_name) AS name, domain_name, COUNT(leads_id) FROM sites
    JOIN clients ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
    LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    GROUP BY domain_name
    ORDER BY name;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client
each month of the year.

    SELECT CONCAT(clients.last_name, ', ', clients.first_name) AS name, SUM(amount), MONTH(charged_datetime) FROM clients
    LEFT JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
    GROUP BY MONTH(charged_datetime)
    ORDER BY name;

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns.
Group the results so that each row shows a new client. Add a new field called
'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

    SELECT CONCAT(last_name, ', ', first_name) AS name, GROUP_CONCAT(domain_name) AS sites FROM clients
    JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    GROUP BY name;
